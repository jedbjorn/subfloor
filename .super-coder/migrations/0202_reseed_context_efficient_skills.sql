-- 0202 — reseed context-efficient shell execution skills.
-- Existing installs receive compact role/spec procedures without losing durable workflow contracts.

INSERT INTO skills (name, description, category, command, common, content, is_deleted) VALUES (

  '# spec — analyze and execute a spec

Load before implementing any feature/spec/roadmap item. A governing spec is
missing -> use `docs` to author it first. Analyze before code; unresolved
ambiguity goes to FnB, while hard blockers get flags. `<self>` = your shell id.

## 1. Select the spec

Never auto-pick the latest document. Read the complete selected body + task
ledger:

```text
sc mem get documents --feature <id>
sc mem get documents --doc <doc_id>
sc mem get tasks --doc <doc_id>
```

The feature list includes `kind`, `seq`, `frozen`, and `task_count`. Resume the
one unfrozen spec with tasks. An unfrozen zero-task spec is backlog; engaging it
creates the plan below. Multiple plausible open specs -> ask FnB. Existing
tasks -> skip planning and track the first unfinished one.

## 2. Analyze before planning

Return these findings before any code or task writes:

| Check | Pass condition / action |
|---|---|
| Viability | Bounded, clear entry points, session-sized verification. Otherwise propose a verifiable slice. Missing done-condition = unclear. |
| Current Posture | Preparation code/DB state matches the documented baseline. A mismatch stops for Planner/FnB; never redefine it silently. |
| Scope | Every In Scope promise is planned; every Out of Scope item stays out. New/substantively revised specs contain both `## Current Posture` and `## Scope`; ambiguity stops. |
| Anticipated User Activity | Plan stated roles, audience/reach, access, validation, recovery, authority, safety, process curation, and tenancy invariants. Older absence is allowed; ambiguity is not. |
| Unclear item | Two plausible readings, missing target/interface, or unstated required knowledge -> ask FnB; do not flag a question they can answer. |
| Blocker | Missing prerequisite/environment/external dependency -> open one High feature flag and stop at its boundary. |

```text
sc mem flag open "[Spec] <blocked fact> | Blocker for: <feature>" \
  --name SC-### --priority High --feature <feature_id>
```

## 3. Engage and plan

Building this session moves `brainstorm|long_term|near_term` to `in_progress`;
planning ahead moves it to `next`. Matching/later stages are no-ops. Reading
for reference moves nothing, and unspec''d small fixes have no stage ceremony.

```text
sc mem roadmap status <feature_id> in_progress
```

Confirm `roadmap.project_id`. Assign the obvious stream; ask FnB if ambiguous;
leave an existing assignment unchanged:

```text
sc mem roadmap project <feature_id> <shortname>
```

Create exactly: Preparation, independently verifiable implementation steps,
then Verification. Each write is immediately durable:

```text
sc mem task add "Preparation" --feature <id> --doc <doc_id> --seq 0 \
  --desc "Read code paths, verify DB state, confirm entry points"
sc mem task add "<step>" --feature <id> --doc <doc_id> --seq <n> \
  --desc "<independently verifiable outcome>"
sc mem task add "Verification" --feature <id> --doc <doc_id> --seq <last> \
  --desc "Test every scope promise, done-condition, audience assurance, snapshot, and render"
sc mem state "[<feature>] — last: —. next: Preparation."
```

No task plan = no implementation.

## 4. Execute one task at a time

When FnB explicitly invoked `--agents`, load `agents`; its adjudicated waves
overlay this loop. Otherwise:

```text
sc mem get tasks --doc <doc_id>
sc mem task start <task_id>
# work and verify only this task
sc mem task done <task_id>
```

After completion, re-read the ledger. Set `current_state` to the highest done
task + lowest pending task. Start the next only after the current task is
verified and durably done. Work moved to another feature/spec is cancelled,
never marked done or left pending under a shipped feature:

```text
sc mem task cancel <task_id> --notes "moved to F<id> as task #<n>"
sc mem state "[<feature>] — last: <last_done>. next: <next_up>."
```

The final Verification task runs focused/full gates, every In Scope
done-condition, and the Anticipated User Activity contract. Unexpected reach,
weakened hardening, or crossed tenancy is a failure. A large spec may stop
after a verified task slice; leave later tasks pending and state the next one.

## 5. Ship and hand docs to Planner

All tasks done + Verification green -> deliver:

1. `sc mem roadmap status <feature_id> shipped`
2. Open one Medium docs-pending feature flag.
3. Message the planner: read shipped code, freeze the spec, write a `kind=doc`
   document under the feature, then close the flag. Confirm the durable message.
4. Tell FnB that code shipped and Planner owns freeze + docs. No planner shell ->
   message nobody; tell FnB and leave the flag open.

```text
sc mem flag open "[Docs] <feature> shipped, doc pending | Blocker for: <feature> doc" \
  --name SC-### --priority Medium --feature <feature_id>
```

Do not freeze or author the shipped doc as Developer.

## Scope change and stop rules

Small growth within the same intent -> revise the unfrozen spec with `docs`, add
tasks, continue. A separate mental model -> stop and recommend a new feature +
spec; never absorb it silently.

Stop for unresolved ambiguity/blocker, at the end of a verified session slice,
or after the shipped/docs handoff. `current_state` must always point to the
durable plan rather than reproduce its rationale.',

  '# sprint_dev — own one editing lane

Use for an actionable work-unit assignment in an armed Sprint. Use the simplest
path supported by current durable state. Treat ownership, lifecycle
preconditions, durable writes, and typed handoffs as hard boundaries; use
judgment inside them. Repeat a read only when later activity could have changed
it or the next command requires live revalidation.

## Route the entry

Load `sprint_dev` on every entry, then classify it:

| Trigger | First read / action |
|---|---|
| Assignment, verdict, question, blocker, relay | Inspect `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once; accept or handle the relevant message. |
| Self-describing engine-wide PR fact | Inspect the fact + registered PR directly. Do not manufacture a Sprint inbox item; check the inbox once immediately before the next typed handoff. |
| Live FnB instruction | Preserve its authority; read only durable state needed for safe action. |

```text
sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>
sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <message-id>
sc sprint decline --sprint <id> --message <message-id> --reason <reason>
```

Accepting marks assignment ownership and starts work. Decline with a concrete
reason when unable to accept. After handling an informational message, run
`accept`; it marks the message read and does not change Sprint or work-unit
state.

Assignments and review requests use Force-new delivery; verdicts and PR-event
wakes use Re-enter. Delivery waits for a natural boundary; the runtime owns
bundling, rotation, and recovery. Stop after a successful typed handoff.

## Bound the lane

Read the assignment, expected output, bound spec revision, dependencies,
Reviewer, repository/worktree, merge grant, and prior judgments. Own at most one
active work unit; never start a second editing lane or edit another shell''s
worktree. Resolve ambiguity with the shippable in-scope reading + recorded
rationale. Ask the Planner before changing the unit boundary, shared interface,
deliverable cut, priority, or scope.

Put one question, blocker, decision, answer, or useful context item in a short
body file. Unit questions/blockers require a reply:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent question --requires-reply --work-unit <work-unit-id> \
  --key <stable-key>
```

Use `--intent blocker` for a blocked lane. Cross-unit, closeout, or external
authority rulings are Sprint-level decisions:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent decision --requires-reply --sprint-level --key <stable-key>
```

Reply through the original message; the server inherits its scope, so never add
`--work-unit` or `--sprint-level` to a reply:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent information --reply-to <message-id> --key <stable-key>
```

Ask the Reviewer about review evidence and the Planner about scope or
cross-unit authority. Confirm the durable reply, then `accept` the incoming
message. At a decision boundary, stop until the required answer arrives;
unread recovery re-wakes, so send no duplicate reminder.

A stable key identifies recipient + exact body + intent + reply linkage +
scope. Reuse it only for the same failed/ambiguous write; when any of those
fields changes, use a new key. Keep bodies near 6,000 characters and below the
8,000-character hard limit; run `wc -m < <path>`. A handoff completes only when
the command exits successfully and confirms its durable message/state + wake.
If a command is rejected or transport fails, correct and retry safely. If the
relay itself fails, give FnB the attempted command, evidence, impact, and
recommendation; invent no alternate protocol.

A Developer does not pause the Sprint. Report blocker or integrity evidence to
the Planner, continue safe independent work, and stop at the unsafe boundary.
The Reviewer decides continue/replan/pause; the Planner executes the decision.

Store scratch proof, diffs, evidence packets, review notes, and report drafts in
gitignored `shared/sprints/sprint-<n>/`. Never commit or PR them. Durable
judgments belong in `record-review`, reports in `sprint_reports`, and decisions
in the relay.

## Build and verify

Sync the assigned repository, branch, implement the smallest complete change,
and exercise the unit''s independent gate + realistic failures. Keep external
calls outside DB transactions; preserve durable identities and append-only
evidence. Record CI failures, infrastructure anomalies, retries, review
friction, and known departures for closeout.

Immediately before `complete-unit`, `register-pr`, or `request-review`, re-run
`sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once and act on new messages. After the typed
handoff confirms its durable write, stop without another inbox pass. The
reopened-PR route below is the sole exception.

## Report-only or no-code completion

Only an explicitly planned report/no-code lane may finish without a PR. Keep
the result near 6,000 characters and below 8,000; run `wc -m < <path>`, perform
the pre-handoff inbox check, then require a durable completion receipt:

```text
sc sprint complete-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> \
  --result-file <path>
```

Stop after success. A code lane continues through merge observation.

## Register and observe the PR

```text
sc sprint register-pr --sprint <id> --repository <owner/name> \
  --pr <number> --work-unit <id>
```

After `register-pr` succeeds, retain ownership through green. The native
registered-PR watcher creates your engine-wide subscription and sends
self-describing red/green/externally-closed PR-event wakes as Re-enter, even
outside an armed Sprint. Fix red; judge green. Planner and Reviewer receive no
PR-event wakes.

If the same registered PR was externally closed, then reopened, rebased, and
pushed, replay the exact `register-pr` command. Require `created: false`, which
keeps identity/ownership and takes a fresh snapshot. Its one pre-handoff inbox
check covers registration replay + the immediately following review request.
Do not wait for a second PR-fact wake: immediately request review. Green
proceeds; any other snapshot returns the watcher diagnostic without partial
handoff. Never register a replacement PR or ask the Planner to bypass observed
green.

Otherwise, when no local action remains, stop for the native PR fact. Start no
recurring loop, scheduled job, daemon, or external watcher. A stalled gate
permits one bounded read, then stop or report its evidence:

```text
sc sprint watcher-state --sprint <id>
```

Do not repeat this read as a polling loop.

## Review handoff and correction

Complete each round in order:

1. Finish readiness judgment + local verification.
2. Perform the once-only inbox check; handle and `accept` new messages.
3. Use `submit` first or `resubmit` after changes requested. The engine injects
   the PR URL, registered id, exact green head, and work-unit id into the
   Reviewer''s canonical bare one-line locator. Create no readiness file. Send
   no scope narrative, verification evidence, rationale, or review-focus
   steering. Put only the work-unit id and spec reference in the PR body; write
   no PR comments or annotations.
4. As the literal final action, run:

```text
sc sprint request-review \
  --sprint <id> --registered-pr <registered-id> \
  --intent <submit|resubmit> --key <stable-key>
```

5. Require confirmation of the durable write + Reviewer wake; run no trailing
   command and stop and await the native verdict wake.

Changes requested returns by Re-enter. Apply every blocking finding,
re-establish green, and resubmit with a new review-round key. Do not narrate
cleared findings; the Reviewer verifies the full diff at the engine-injected
head. Record disagreements as judgment. Reviewer owns scope/severity; Planner
executes resulting action.

## Merge boundary

Approval is stale evidence. Immediately before merge, re-read live GitHub,
grant, ownership, unit state, approved head, and checks through:

```text
sc sprint authorize-merge \
  --sprint <id> --registered-pr <registered-id>
```

Merge only the returned repository, PR, and head SHA. A refusal means wait for
the watcher or re-enter the appropriate loop; never bypass it.

## Post-merge handoff

After the authorized merge:

1. Clean the worktree; put merged PR + SHA, unit result, verification,
   judgments, and departures in the handoff file.
2. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once; handle and `accept` new items.
3. Run `wc -m < <path>`; keep the body near 6,000 characters and below 8,000.
4. As the literal final action, send:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <planner-shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent handoff --key <stable-merged-handoff-key>
```

5. Require the durable message + Planner wake, then stop immediately. Run no trailing Git,
   Sprint, inbox, cleanup, or status command. Automatic merge
   observation records the PR transition; this handoff releases the next wave.

## Report and stop

Report broken bases, destructive ambiguity, unavailable GitHub, untrustworthy
runners, provider exhaustion, or unrecoverable environment with evidence,
impact, and recommendation. Stop when merged + reported, declined, returned to
review, paused for a native wake, or awaiting Planner/FnB recovery. Ask for
later work only after this editing lane is terminal.',

  '# sprint_pln — govern the armed Sprint

Use as originating Planner after `sprint_prep` arms a Sprint. System records
facts; Reviewer owns review/conformance judgment + reports; Planner owns plan
structure and executes control transitions. FnB retains board-level override
under decision #46.

Use the simplest path supported by current durable state. Treat authority,
lifecycle preconditions, durable writes, and typed handoffs as hard boundaries.
Repeat a read only when later activity could have changed it or the next command
requires live revalidation.

## Route the entry

Load `sprint_pln` on every entry, then classify:

| Trigger | Route |
|---|---|
| Sprint decision, merged-work handoff, question, blocker, relay | Inspect `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once; handle that message. |
| Self-contained clean-completion receipt | Inspect receipt + terminal state directly; it is informational—do not run the Sprint inbox, accept it, or close again. |
| Live FnB instruction | Act under board override; name FnB authority in durable evidence. |

Do not poll. Armed runtime owns scheduled dispatch + unread wake recovery;
registered-PR watcher owns subscription observation. Developer-owned subscriptions send
red/green/closed facts to Developers, never Planner.

Assignments/review requests use Force-new delivery; Planner-bound results use
Re-enter. Delivery waits for a natural boundary; runtime owns bundling,
rotation, recovery, and coordinate mode. Stop after a successful typed handoff.

## Durable running loop

Read only lifecycle, unit, dependency, route, PR, expectation, and anomaly
facts required by the trigger. Browser presence is not progress.

```text
sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>
sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <message-id>
sc sprint decline --sprint <id> --message <message-id> --reason <reason>
sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>
```

Dispatch every dependency-ready lane; returned ids are wake identities.
Disposition + messages are release facts. Stable assignment generations and
occupied lanes make dispatch repeat-safe.

Accept/decline only actionable items. After acting on an informational message,
run `accept`; it marks the message read and does not change Sprint or work-unit
state.

- Keep dependencies as hard sequence; restructure current projection under
  Planner authority, record why, and never rewrite completed history.
- Developers own PR green/review/correction/merge. Reviewers own verdicts and
  conformance. Do not proxy routine handoffs or judgments.
- Record Reviewer decision id + exact action + receipt; never rewrite rationale
  as Planner judgment.
- Mid-Sprint spec edits require owning Planner/FnB + durable Reviewer decision.
  Record old/new revision hashes; binding changes only when the decision says so.
- Use native wakes. Start no recurring loop, scheduled job, manual participant
  boot, or external watcher. One stalled-gate inspection is allowed:

```text
sc sprint watcher-state --sprint <id>
```

Do not repeat this read as a polling loop. Act on its bounded watcher evidence,
then return to native delivery.

## Relay contract

Unit question/blocker requiring reply:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent question --requires-reply --work-unit <work-unit-id> \
  --key <stable-key>
```

Use `--intent blocker` for a blocked lane. Cross-unit, closeout, or external
authority rulings are Sprint-level:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent decision --requires-reply --sprint-level --key <stable-key>
```

Answer through the original message; the server inherits its scope, so never
add `--work-unit` or `--sprint-level` to a reply:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent information --reply-to <message-id> --key <stable-key>
```

Confirm reply, then `accept` incoming. A missing answer stops at the decision
boundary; unread recovery re-wakes, so send no duplicate. Choose a stable key
for recipient + body + intent + reply + scope; reuse it only for that identical
write. When any of those fields changes, use a new key.

Keep bodies near 6,000 characters and below the 8,000 hard maximum; run
`wc -m < <path>`. Handoff completes only when the command exits successfully
and confirms durable write + wake. If a command is rejected or transport fails,
correct/retry safely. If relay itself fails, give FnB attempted command +
durable evidence; invent no alternate protocol. Relay Developer integrity
evidence, impact, and recommendation to Reviewer. Send required context before
pausing because paused Sprint relay is unavailable.

Keep scratch review notes, diffs, evidence, reports, and proof in gitignored
`shared/sprints/sprint-<n>/`; never commit/branch/PR them. Durable judgment,
reports, and decisions belong in `record-review`, `sprint_reports`, and relay.

## Reviewer decisions and Planner actions

Review/conformance/re-enter/abort judgment remains Reviewer-owned. Planner
independently owns operational plan structure: pause-safe recall, cancellation
of unreleased scope, reassignment, repeated task lanes, and route changes.

For a required-reply Reviewer→Planner Re-enter decision, keep this order:

1. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`; verify assigned Reviewer + retain id.
2. Send linked acknowledgement:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <reviewer-shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent information --reply-to <decision-message-id> \
  --key <stable-control-reply-key>
```

3. Require the reply command to confirm its durable message and wake; retry the
   same command/key if ambiguous.
4. Accept the decision:

```text
sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <decision-message-id>
```

5. Only after acceptance, execute the requested transition without
   re-adjudicating it. The linked reply must precede any pause or
   abort that makes the Sprint relay unavailable.

Record decision id + reply, acceptance, and action receipts. Clean conformance
closes atomically and sends informational receipt; no reply/accept is needed.

The FnB board-level override from decision #46 remains distinct. If action
fails lifecycle/authority/disposition precondition, send refusal + durable state
to Reviewer (or FnB for override), substitute nothing, and stop.

### Pause or resume

Pause for Reviewer decision or safe Planner restructuring; preserve partial
artifacts, interrupt intent, judgment, and evidence:

```text
sc sprint pause --sprint <id> --reason <decision-or-restructure-reason>
```

Resume only after recording recovery/restructure and reconciling native runs,
unread messages, wakes, units, PRs, capacity, and spec drift:

```text
sc sprint resume --sprint <id> [--reason <validated-reconciliation-reason>]
```

Exhausted recovery wake = bounded manual evidence: preserve unread message +
failed wake, involve FnB, create no recursive fallback. Drift informs but never
silently blocks resume.

Aborted-Sprint PR ownership repair belongs to the originating Planner. Keep
replacement Sprint paused; establish old/new identity. The originating Planner
may reconcile that identity (FnB may override):

```text
sc sprint reconcile-pr --sprint <replacement-id> --repository <owner/repo> \
  --pr <number> --work-unit <replacement-unit-id> --reason <recovery-reason>
```

It refuses a live source Sprint or target Sprint, a non-originating Planner,
invalid/owned target, and closed-unmerged PR. Receipt records owners, live head,
authority, and merged completion when applicable. Require a separate Reviewer
decision before resuming.

### Modify, recall, repeat, reassign, or reroute

Cancel unreleased scope with retained terminal reason/Reviewer id:

```text
sc sprint cancel-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> --reason <reason>
```

Edit an unreleased lane; omitted fields stay, `--clear-dependencies` means none:

```text
sc sprint replan-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> \
  [--developer-shell <id>] [--reviewer-shell <id>] [--title <title>] \
  [--expected-output-file <path>] [--task <task-id>] [--wave <n>] \
  [--depends-on <work-unit-id> | --clear-dependencies] \
  [--output-kind code|report-only|no-code]
```

Never edit a released lane in place. Pause → recall unmerged lane → replan →
resume:

```text
sc sprint pause --sprint <id> --reason <restructure-reason>
sc sprint recall-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> --reason <obsolete-reason>
sc sprint replan-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> <changed-fields>
sc sprint resume --sprint <id> --reason <validated-replan-reason>
```

Recall preserves message/event history, returns only unmerged work to planned,
and refuses terminal/PR-bound work. PR-bound work stays; plan replacement or use
reconciliation. Resume creates fresh assignment generation. One spec task may
govern repeated verification/replacement lanes; each lane lists it once. Do not
duplicate the spec task.

To change future assignment/review model, pause armed Sprint, clear released
expectation, then validate + replace route:

```text
sc sprint reroute-participant --sprint <id> --participant-shell <id> \
  --harness <harness> [--model <model>] [--effort <effort>] \
  [--route <display-route>]
```

Prepared Sprints may reroute directly. Armed Developer route rejects released
lane; Reviewer route rejects in-review lane. Existing chats/runs remain history;
next Force-new delivery uses replacement. Reroute declared participants only.
On decline, preserve reason and choose replacement from current capacity; ask
Reviewer only if review/conformance judgment changes.

### Re-enter after conformance

Reviewer decision names findings; governing tasks (existing for same scope,
new title/description for new scope); and grouping, waves, dependencies,
routing, capacity. Preserve it; do not absorb extra/post-Sprint scope or
maximize occupancy.

```text
sc mem task add "<task-title>" --feature <feature-id> \
  --doc <governing-spec-document-id> --seq <next-seq> \
  --desc "<task-description>"

sc sprint plan-unit --sprint <id> \
  --developer-shell <id> --reviewer-shell <id> --title <title> \
  --expected-output-file <path> --task <task-id> \
  [--task <task-id>] [--wave <n>] [--depends-on <work-unit-id>] \
  [--output-kind code|report-only|no-code]
```

Reuse task for exact repair/repeat; add only genuinely new scope. Bind every
task, then confirm routes + dependency graph and capacity plan match the
decision. Planner may reassign or reroute for operational capacity; tell
Reviewer if conflict changes scope/judgment. Release ready lanes with
`sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>`. Engine sends next delivery-terminal wake;
Planner does not initiate conformance.

### Conclude or abort

The clean `record-conformance` command atomically stores conformance, follow-ups,
Reviewer-authored final report, completion, and informational engine-wide
Planner receipt. On Re-enter, verify Sprint/reports/outcome/completed state.
Do not run `complete`; notification is informational because closure is already
terminal. Planner does not author a second report. The originating Planner and
report-authoring Reviewer remain open. Do not manually close peer chats. Pause,
abort, re-entry, failed conformance, and rejected fallback retain no-cleanup
behavior.

Do not compile or editorialize by default; Reviewer owns evidence/report. Only
FnB-directed fallback may run:

```text
sc sprint compile-report --sprint <id> --limit 50 \
  > shared/sprints/sprint-<n>/evidence.json
```

Abort only on Reviewer decision/FnB override; it is terminal and deletes
nothing.

## Handoffs and stop

Planner receives no PR-event wakes. Never dispatch the next wave from merge
observation. The merged-work handoff wake is the only normal next-wave dispatch trigger.
On it:

1. Run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`; inspect merged handoff + unit/dependency state.
2. Handle earlier informational items and `accept` each, including handoff.
3. Finish reconciliation and Planner bookkeeping; no work remains.
4. As literal final action run `sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>`.
5. Require durable assignments + New wakes, then stop. Run no trailing command.
   Empty dispatch remains final; investigate only on a later durable wake.

On a clean completion receipt, verify terminal Sprint + bounded receipt; run no
close command. Planner does not author a second report, accept an actionable
handoff, or wait for another actor to finish the Sprint.',

  '# sprint_rev — independent review and conformance

Use for pre-declaration QAQC, one work-unit review, or whole-Sprint
conformance. The Reviewer decides review/conformance; the Planner owns
operational plan structure + control execution. FnB retains the board-level
override from decision #46.

Use the simplest path supported by current durable state. Treat independence,
authority, lifecycle preconditions, durable writes, and typed handoffs as hard
boundaries. Repeat a read only when later activity could have changed it or the
next command requires live revalidation.

## Route the entry

Classify the entry before reading an inbox:

| Entry | Route |
|---|---|
| Explicit pre-declaration request | Read/sign the exact current spec directly; there is no Sprint id or Sprint inbox to inspect yet. |
| Work-unit review / `sprint.delivery_terminal` | Inspect the Sprint inbox once; accept the actionable request. |
| Live FnB instruction | Preserve board-level authority; read only durable state needed for independent judgment. |

QAQC precedes all Sprint inbox commands:

```text
sc sprint record-qaqc --document <spec-document-id> \
  --verdict pass [--findings-document <document-id>]
```

For an armed Sprint, load `sprint_rev` on every entry:

```text
sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>
sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <message-id>
sc sprint decline --sprint <id> --message <message-id> --reason <reason>
```

Decline actionable work only with a concrete reason. After handling an
informational message, run `accept`; it marks the message read and does not
change Sprint or work-unit state.

Review requests use Force-new delivery. Verdicts and Planner decisions use
Re-enter. Delivery waits for a natural boundary; the runtime owns bundling,
rotation, and recovery. Stop after a successful typed handoff. Reviewers never
receive PR-event wakes.

## Relay contract and authority

Ask the Developer for unit evidence with a unit-scoped question/blocker:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent question --requires-reply --work-unit <work-unit-id> \
  --key <stable-key>
```

Use `--intent blocker` when the unit cannot advance. Cross-unit, closeout,
re-enter, abort, and safety rulings are Sprint-level decisions:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent decision --requires-reply --sprint-level --key <stable-key>
```

Reply through the original message; the server inherits its scope, so never
add `--work-unit` or `--sprint-level` to a reply:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent information --reply-to <message-id> --key <stable-key>
```

Confirm a reply, then `accept` its incoming message. Missing facts stop review
at the decision boundary; unread recovery re-wakes, so send no duplicate.
A stable key identifies recipient + exact body + intent + reply + scope. Reuse
it only for the same failed/ambiguous write; when any of those fields changes,
use a new key.

Keep bodies near 6,000 characters and below the 8,000 hard maximum; run
`wc -m < <path>`. A handoff completes only when the command exits successfully
and confirms the durable write + wake. If a command is rejected or transport fails,
the verdict/handoff is incomplete. Correct and retry safely. If the relay itself fails,
give FnB the attempted command, evidence, impact, and recommendation; invent no
alternate protocol.

## Sprint artifact paths

Keep review notes, diffs, evidence, reports, and scratch proof in gitignored
`shared/sprints/sprint-<n>/`; never commit, branch, or PR them. Durable records
belong in `record-review`, `sprint_reports`, and the relay.

## Conformance decisions and Planner controls

Reviewer owns review, re-enter, abort, and conclude judgments. Planner
independently owns operational plan structure: safe-edit pauses, recalling
unreleased work, lane changes/repeats, assignment/routing, unreleased-scope
cancellation, and validated resume. Reviewer never runs standalone pause,
replan, recall, reroute, cancel, resume, complete, or abort actions; clean
`record-conformance` alone performs its narrow atomic close.

Base judgment on durable Sprint state, bound revisions, current work/PR facts,
progress-carrier evidence, and ratified judgments. Every Reviewer→Planner route
is Re-enter. A decision body names:

- `decision`: `re-enter`, `abort`, or the exact safety-critical recommendation;
- Reviewer-owned evidence + rationale;
- exact Sprint/unit ids, reason, outcome, and complete action arguments;
- immediate safety impact for FnB.

Planner verifies Reviewer identity and executes the transition without
surrendering plan authority. A rejected action requires a revised judgment
supported by returned durable state, never an improvised bypass. A live FnB
instruction supersedes as distinct FnB board-level override authority under
decision #46.

## Severity rubric

- **Critical** — active security/authority violation, destructive corruption,
  or unsafe continued operation.
- **Major** — wrong behavior, data loss, broken invariant, material spec
  violation, or silently wedged delivery/recovery.
- **Medium** — concrete normal-use correctness/recovery gap, missing negative
  enforcement, or unreliable handoff.
- **Low** — bounded cleanup, clarity, test-depth, or resilience improvement;
  delivered behavior remains correct.

Critical/Major/Medium block unit approval; Low is a report note. At closeout,
severity does not decide timing: Reviewer judges whether each finding requires in-Sprint patching
or acceptable post-Sprint follow-up.

## Work-unit review

Accept the request and retain that exact message id. Its body is a bare locator:
intent, PR URL, registered PR id, exact head, work-unit id. Scope narrative,
verification, rationale, or focus steering is a protocol defect. PR comments
and annotations are forbidden; PR body contains only unit id + spec reference.

Bind inspection/verdict to the accepted request''s message id, registered PR,
work unit, and exact head. Review each request explicitly. Read the exact spec
revision + full diff at that head, then checks, tests, relevant runtime facts,
and ratified judgments. Each round is clean: no prior Developer evidence or
prose; prior findings clear only when the new head proves it. Trace code paths,
failure cases, and spec behavior rather than names or PR prose.

### Red-check doctrine

Accepted-red is not a legal review outcome. A departure that leaves checks
failing is never acceptable; the handoff remains green-only, without exception
or waiver: do not note the failure and approve anyway.

- In-scope failure -> record `changes_requested` so the Developer fixes them and restores green.
- Out-of-scope failure -> keep the lane unapproved and send the Planner a `replan`
  decision naming the failures; Planner widens the lane or cuts follow-up work.

Read cited and feature-scoped resolved flag evidence through memory, never SQL:

```text
sc mem get flags <flag-id>
sc mem get flags --feature <feature-id> --resolved
```

Each finding pins severity/title, violated invariant, exact location/evidence,
reproducible consequence, and fix boundary without unnecessary architecture.

Complete a unit verdict in this exact order:

1. Finish every inspection, finding, and verdict body.
2. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once; handle + `accept` new items.
3. Run `wc -m < <path>`; require near 6,000 and below 8,000 characters.
4. As the literal final action, run:

```text
sc sprint record-review \
  --sprint <id> --registered-pr <registered-id> \
  --verdict changes_requested --body-file <path> --key <stable-key>
```

5. Require durable judgment evidence + Developer Re-enter wake. Run no trailing command;
   stop.

Use `approved` only with no Critical/Major/Medium finding. Engine validation
requires the accepted request and reviewed head. Do not message around the
surface; an unrecorded verdict cannot unlock merge.

## Delivery-terminal closeout

Retain the exact notification message id + delivered wake as this closeout
episode''s identity. Inspect inbox, lifecycle, and units first:

- Already completed/aborted -> `accept` notification and stop.
- If any non-terminal unit is visible, the wake is stale -> `accept`, stop, and
  await a fresh delivery-terminal episode.
- Only an armed Sprint whose units are all terminal enters conformance.

Compile the bounded evidence packet first, yourself:

```text
sc sprint compile-report --sprint <id> --limit 50 \
  > shared/sprints/sprint-<n>/evidence.json
```

Increase only when truncation omitted needed evidence; maximum 200. Judge
integrated `main` against every bound/current revision + ratified judgment. All
units cancelled and nothing shipped -> `abort`, not `conclude`.

Choose one branch:

- **In-Sprint patching required.** Do not run `record-conformance`. Send Planner
  a durable `re-enter` decision with every blocking finding; each spec task''s
  title and description; grouping, waves, dependencies, routing, and capacity
  rationale. State independent lanes, expected review overlap, useful reserve,
  and critical-path effect. After three re-entry episodes, escalate
  non-convergence to FnB.
- **Clean or post-Sprint-only findings.** Prepare conformance report, findings,
  final report, reason, and outcome; submit the atomic close below. Send no
  conclude message.

## Whole-Sprint conformance

Review the integrated system, not unit diffs. Classify every requirement
`as-specced`, `deviated-intentionally` with ratified judgment,
`deviated-silently`, or `unimplemented`; the last two are findings. Include
spec document + work-unit ids when known.

For the clean branch, write a conformance report and JSON findings array with
`severity`, `title`, `body`, `spec_document_id`, and `work_unit_id`. Keep the
report and each body near 6,000 and below 8,000 characters; run
`wc -m < <report>` and validate each body.

Before recording conformance, author the final Sprint report. Name Reviewer as
author and cover governing scope/revisions, shipped units/PRs, judgments +
ratified deviations, failures/retries/recovery/anomalies, conclusion,
follow-ups, and evidence location. Keep it near 6,000 and below 8,000; preserve
discrepancies.

Record one atomic final write:

```text
sc sprint record-conformance \
  --sprint <id> --body-file <report> --findings-file <json> \
  --final-report-file <final-report> --reason <reason> --outcome <outcome> \
  --key <stable-pass-key>
```

Require receipt: conformance report id, final report id, follow-up ids,
completed state, Planner message id, and Planner wake id. The transaction adds
append-only evidence, follow-ups, terminal state, and one informational engine-wide Planner Re-enter;
send no conclude message. Successful conformance also closes other Sprint-linked
chats while the originating Planner + report-authoring Reviewer stay open. Do
not manually close peer chats. Pause, abort, re-entry, failed conformance, and
rejected fallback retain no-cleanup behavior. Never reopen editing after recording; a re-enter defers
reports until new scope is terminal and a fresh delivery-terminal wake arrives.

## Stop

Unit review ends with the ordered `record-review` write as the literal final
action.

For closeout, first re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`, handle + `accept`
new messages, then confirm every artifact/body is final and below 8,000.

- Clean conclude -> run the atomic `record-conformance` command above as the
  literal final action. When it confirms completed state and all receipt
  identities, stop immediately; Planner is notified.
- Re-enter/abort -> as literal final action send:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <planner-shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent decision --requires-reply --sprint-level \
  --key <stable-decision-handoff-key>
```

Require durable write + Planner wake, then stop immediately. Run no trailing
command until another native wake.',
