  '# sprint_dev — own one editing lane

Use for an actionable work-unit assignment in an armed Sprint. Marking that
Sprint message read is acceptance and starts work immediately. If you cannot
accept, decline with a concrete reason; never leave it unread and waking.
On every wake or re-entry, load `sprint_dev`, run the exact inbox command below,
and inspect the durable message before deciding what to do.

```text
sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>
sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <message-id>
sc sprint decline --sprint <id> --message <message-id> --reason <reason>
```

Use `accept` or `decline` for actionable work. After acting on an informational
question, answer, blocker, or context message, run `accept` for that message.
For informational messages it only marks the message read; it does not change
Sprint or work-unit state.

## Orient and bound the lane

Read the assignment, expected output, bound spec revision, dependencies,
assigned Reviewer, repository/worktree, merge grant, and prior judgments. One
Developer shell may own one active work unit in the Sprint. Do not start a
second editing lane or edit another shell''s worktree.

If the requirement is ambiguous, choose the shippable reading within your
unit''s scope, record the choice and rationale, and continue. Escalate changes to
the unit boundary, interfaces another unit consumes, deliverable cuts, or scope
growth to the Planner.

The active-chat registry, not Sprint participant pointers, owns your current
chat. Assignments are declared New, but a verified live turn is never displaced:
delivery enters this chat at its natural boundary and drains every undelivered
wake message. When idle, New rotates to a fresh chat; Re-enter resumes the
registry chat; no registry row behaves as New. A generous inactivity ceiling
unlinks a silent hung turn so the 60-second reaper can terminate its verified
process identity.

## Questions, answers, blockers, and failures

Write a concrete question, answer, blocker, or useful context to a short body
file, then send it durably to the participant who can act:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --key <stable-key>
```

Ask the Planner about scope, priority, or cross-unit decisions; ask the assigned
Reviewer about review evidence. Answer an incoming question through `send` so it
wakes the asker, confirm that write, then mark the handled question read with
`accept`. For a blocker or integrity concern, send the Planner concise evidence,
impact, the exact action needed, and your recommendation. Continue safe
independent work, but stop at a decision boundary when the answer is required.
No immediate response is not a reason to send duplicates: the durable message
and recovery reconciler own re-waking.

Choose one stable key for the intended recipient and exact body. Reuse it only
when retrying that same write; use a new key when the recipient or body changes.

Keep this Sprint message or result at about 6,000 characters or fewer; 8,000
characters is the hard maximum. Before submitting, run `wc -m < <path>` and
condense if needed. The handoff is complete only when the Sprint command exits
successfully and confirms the durable write and wake where applicable.

If a Sprint command is rejected or transport fails, the write or handoff is
incomplete. Correct and retry when safe. If the relay itself fails, surface the
attempted command, evidence, impact, and recommendation to FnB; do not invent an
alternate delivery protocol. A Developer does not pause the Sprint. The
Reviewer decides whether the evidence warrants continuing, re-planning, or
pausing; the Planner executes that decision.

## Build and verify

Sync the assigned repository, work on a feature branch, match the surrounding
code, and implement the smallest complete change. Keep external calls outside
database transactions. Preserve durable identities and append-only evidence.

Verification must exercise the unit''s independent stage gate and realistic
failure paths. A local exploratory number is not merge evidence. Record real CI
failures, anomalous infrastructure failures, retries, review friction, and
known departures for the final report.

An explicitly planned report-only or no-code lane completes with its durable
result instead of a PR. Code lanes cannot use this path; they complete only
after merge authorization and observation.

Keep the result at about 6,000 characters or fewer; 8,000 is the hard maximum.
Run `wc -m < <path>` before submitting, then require a successful command and
durable completion receipt.

```text
sc sprint complete-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> \
  --result-file <path>
```

Register the PR through the authoritative Sprint surface and retain ownership
until it is green. After `register-pr` succeeds, the native registered-PR
watcher creates an engine-wide subscription owned by your shell. It supplies
self-describing red, green, and externally closed facts as Re-enter wakes even
after chat rotation or outside an armed Sprint. On red, diagnose and fix the PR.
On green, judge readiness rather than forwarding mechanically. Planner and
Reviewer receive no PR-event wakes.

```text
sc sprint register-pr --sprint <id> --repository <owner/name> \
  --pr <number> --work-unit <id>
```

When no local implementation action remains, stop and await the native PR-fact
wake. Use Sprint-native wakes for coordination. Do not start a recurring shell
loop, scheduled job, manual watcher daemon, or external PR watcher to track the
registered PR.

## Review handoff

Complete a review handoff in this exact order:

1. Finish the readiness claim and every local verification step.
2. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`, act on newly arrived messages, and
   mark every handled informational message read with `accept`.
3. Run `wc -m < <path>`; keep the claim near 6,000 characters and below the
   8,000-character hard maximum.
4. As the literal final action of the turn, send the typed handoff with one
   stable retry key:

```text
sc sprint request-review \
  --sprint <id> --registered-pr <registered-id> \
  --readiness-file <path> --key <stable-key>
```

5. When the command confirms the durable write and Reviewer wake, immediately
   stop and await the native verdict wake. Run no trailing command.

A changes-requested verdict
returns as Re-enter to your registry chat. Apply every blocking finding,
re-establish green, and hand back with a new stable review key. Record
disagreements as judgment; the Reviewer owns scope/severity decisions and the
Planner executes any resulting action.

## Merge boundary

Approval alone is stale evidence. Immediately before merge, ask the engine to
re-read live GitHub state and revalidate the armed grant, ownership, work-unit
state, approved head, and checks:

```text
sc sprint authorize-merge \
  --sprint <id> --registered-pr <registered-id>
```

Merge only the exact repository, PR number, and head SHA returned. If the
command refuses, do not work around it; wait for the watcher or return to the
appropriate loop.

## Post-merge handoff

After the exact authorized merge succeeds, complete close-out in this order:

1. Clean the worktree and collect the merged PR identity, merge SHA, unit
   result, verification evidence, and judgments in the handoff body file.
2. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`, act on newly arrived messages, and
   mark every handled informational message read with `accept`.
3. Run `wc -m < <path>`; keep the report near 6,000 characters and below the
   8,000-character hard maximum.
4. As the literal final action of the turn, send the merged-work handoff to the
   Planner:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <planner-shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --key <stable-merged-handoff-key>
```

5. When the command confirms the durable write and Planner wake, stop
   immediately. Run no trailing Git, Sprint, inbox, cleanup, or status command.
   Automatic merge observation records the durable PR transition; the Planner
   uses this handoff wake to release the next wave.

## Report and stop

Report broken bases, destructive ambiguity, unavailable GitHub, untrustworthy
runners, provider exhaustion, or an unrecoverable environment to the Planner
with evidence, impact, and a recommendation. Stop at the unsafe boundary while
the Reviewer decides whether to continue, re-plan, or pause and the Planner
executes that decision.

Stop when the unit is merged and reported, declined, awaiting Planner/FnB
recovery, or returned to review. For normal review and merge handoffs, the
ordered procedures above place inbox handling before the typed handoff and make
that handoff the turn''s last action. Ask the Planner for later work only after
the current editing lane is terminal.',

  '# sprint_rev — independent review and conformance

Use in one of two modes: a work-unit PR review during the loop, or the final
whole-Sprint conformance pass. Pre-declaration QAQC is a third entry condition,
before a Sprint exists. The evidence differs; independence does not. The
Reviewer decides and documents; the Planner acts. The FnB retains the
board-level override established by decision #46.

## Entry and durable state

Pre-declaration QAQC begins from an explicit Planner or FnB request. Read the
exact current spec document and sign that body directly; there is no Sprint id
or Sprint inbox to inspect yet:

```text
sc sprint record-qaqc --document <spec-document-id> \
  --verdict pass [--findings-document <document-id>]
```

Once a Sprint is armed, every review or conformance entry arrives through its
durable wake/inbox. On every wake or re-entry, load `sprint_rev`, inspect the
message, and accept the actionable request before beginning:

```text
sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>
sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <message-id>
```

Decline an actionable request you cannot take, with a concrete reason:

```text
sc sprint decline --sprint <id> --message <message-id> --reason <reason>
```

Use `accept` or `decline` for actionable work. After acting on an informational
question, answer, blocker, or context message, run `accept` for that message.
For informational messages it only marks the message read; it does not change
Sprint or work-unit state.

Review requests are declared New, but wake type resolves at delivery. A verified
live turn is never displaced: delivery enters the active registry chat at its
natural boundary and drains every undelivered wake message. When idle, New
rotates to a fresh chat; Re-enter resumes the registry chat; no registry row
behaves as New. Reviewer verdicts to Developers and decisions to Planners are
Re-enter. Reviewers never receive PR-event subscription wakes.

## Questions, answers, blockers, and failures

Put a concrete question, answer, blocker, or useful context in a short body file
and send it to the participant who can act. Ask the Developer for missing PR
evidence and the Planner for durable state or action-feasibility facts. Do not
delegate Reviewer judgment to the Planner:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --key <stable-key>
```

Answer incoming questions through `send` so the answer is durable and wakes the
asker, confirm that write, then mark the handled question read with `accept`. A
blocker or integrity concern is evidence for your decision. If action is needed,
send the Planner the decision, impact, exact action, and recommendation through
the protocol below. Continue independent safe review, but stop when missing
facts prevent an honest decision at the decision boundary. Do not send duplicate
reminders; unread recovery owns re-waking.

Choose one stable key for the intended recipient and exact body. Reuse it only
when retrying that same write; use a new key when the recipient or body changes.

Keep this Sprint message or result at about 6,000 characters or fewer; 8,000
characters is the hard maximum. Before submitting, run `wc -m < <path>` and
condense if needed. The handoff is complete only when the Sprint command exits
successfully and confirms the durable write and wake where applicable.

If a Sprint command is rejected or transport fails, the verdict or handoff is
incomplete. Correct and retry when safe. If the relay itself fails, surface the
attempted command, evidence, impact, and recommendation to FnB; do not invent an
alternate delivery protocol. A Reviewer decides whether the condition warrants
continuing, re-planning, pausing, cancellation, or conclusion, but does not
invoke the lifecycle transition. Send the durable decision to the Planner, who
executes it. A live FnB board-level override may supersede that decision and
must be recorded as FnB authority, not Reviewer judgment.

## Control and conclude decisions

The Reviewer owns all pause, cancel, and conclude decisions and recommendations.
The Planner owns all resulting actions. Base a decision on durable Sprint state,
the exact bound revisions, current work/PR facts, liveness evidence, and any
ratified judgment; ambiguous silence is not enough to corrupt a disposition.

Send each decision to the Planner through the durable `send` surface above. The
Reviewer → Planner route is Re-enter. The body must name:

- `decision`: `pause`, `resume`, `replan`, `cancel`, `conclude`, or `abort`;
- the evidence and rationale owned by the Reviewer;
- exact Sprint/work-unit ids, reason, outcome, and complete action arguments;
- for conclude, the conformance report/follow-up ids, stable completion key,
  and full Reviewer-authored final Sprint report body; and
- any immediate safety impact that the FnB must see.

The Planner accepts the actionable message, verifies the assigned Reviewer,
and executes exactly that transition. The Reviewer never runs the pause,
replan, cancel, resume, complete, or abort action. If the action is rejected, inspect
the returned durable state and issue a new decision only when the evidence
supports one; never ask the Planner to improvise around a precondition.

The FnB board-level override from decision #46 is unaffected. A live FnB
instruction can direct or supersede any decision; preserve it as a distinct
authority record.

## Severity rubric

This skill owns severity. The governing spec intentionally does not.

- **Critical** — active security/authority violation, destructive corruption,
  or a condition that makes continued operation unsafe.
- **Major** — wrong behavior, data loss, broken invariant, material spec
  violation, or a loop/recovery path that can silently wedge delivery.
- **Medium** — a concrete correctness or recovery gap likely to bite normal
  use soon, including missing negative enforcement or an unreliable handoff.
- **Low** — bounded cleanup, clarity, test depth, or resilience improvement that
  does not make the delivered behavior wrong now.

During a work-unit review, Critical/Major/Medium block approval; Low is a
report note. During close-out conformance, every severity becomes a follow-up
and none is fixed inside the Sprint.

## Work-unit review

Accept the actionable review request, then inspect the exact bound spec
revision, readiness claim, PR head, diff, checks, tests, relevant runtime
evidence, and prior judgment calls. Review code quality, edge cases/failure
paths, and spec conformance. Trace the real path; do not trust names or PR prose.

Read resolved closure evidence through the authenticated memory surface; no SQL
or mutation is needed. Use the exact form for a cited flag and the scoped form
to audit every resolved flag attached to the feature:

```text
sc mem get flags <flag-id>
sc mem get flags --feature <feature-id> --resolved
```

Findings must state:

- severity and concise title;
- violated behavior or invariant;
- exact code/evidence location;
- a reproducible consequence; and
- the fix boundary, without prescribing unnecessary architecture.

Complete a unit verdict in this exact order:

1. Finish the review, findings, and verdict body; no inspection remains after
   this step.
2. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`, act on newly arrived messages, and
   mark every handled informational message read with `accept`.
3. Run `wc -m < <path>`; keep the verdict near 6,000 characters and below the
   8,000-character hard maximum.
4. As the literal final action of the turn, record the typed verdict through
   the authenticated surface:

```text
sc sprint record-review \
  --sprint <id> --registered-pr <registered-id> \
  --verdict changes_requested --body-file <path> --key <stable-key>
```

5. When the command confirms the durable write and Developer wake, stop
   immediately. Run no trailing command.

Use `approved` only when no Critical/Major/Medium finding remains. The engine
checks that the request was accepted and still binds to the reviewed head,
records judgment evidence, sends a Re-enter wake to the Developer, and
resolves the review liveness expectation. Do not message around this surface;
an unrecorded verdict cannot unlock merge.

## Whole-Sprint conformance

Judge integrated `main` against every governing bound revision, plus the exact
recorded mid-Sprint revision facts and ratified judgments. Review the integrated
system, not unit diffs. Compile the bounded evidence packet first:

```text
sc sprint compile-report --sprint <id> --limit 50 > evidence.json
```

Increase the bound only when truncation counters show the default omitted
needed evidence; 200 is the maximum. The packet supplies facts, not judgment.

Then classify each requirement as:

- `as-specced`;
- `deviated-intentionally` with its ratified judgment;
- `deviated-silently`; or
- `unimplemented`.

The last two are findings. Include spec document id and work-unit id when known.
Write the conformance report and a JSON findings array:

```json
[
  {
    "severity": "Major",
    "title": "Integrated seam diverges",
    "body": "Evidence and consequence.",
    "spec_document_id": 46,
    "work_unit_id": 9
  }
]
```

Then record both atomically:

Keep the conformance report and each finding body at about 6,000 characters or
fewer; 8,000 is the hard maximum for each. Run `wc -m < <report>` and length-check
each finding body before submission. Require the successful report and
follow-up receipt before stopping.

```text
sc sprint record-conformance \
  --sprint <id> --body-file <report> --findings-file <json> \
  --key <stable-pass-key>
```

This creates append-only conformance evidence and pending follow-ups for FnB
disposition. It must not create a fix lane, reopen a completed work unit, or
send findings to a Developer for in-Sprint repair — including Critical ones.
Surface immediate safety risk to the FnB, but preserve the close-out rule.

Then author the final Sprint report. Name the Reviewer as its author and answer:

1. Which exact scope and revisions governed?
2. What shipped, through which work units and PRs?
3. Which Reviewer judgments and ratified deviations shaped the result?
4. What failed, retried, paused, recovered, or remained anomalous?
5. What did conformance conclude?
6. Which follow-ups or unresolved items require FnB disposition?
7. Where is the complete evidence?

Keep the final report at about 6,000 characters or fewer and below the 8,000
hard maximum; run `wc -m < <report>`. Do not smooth discrepancies into a
success narrative. If the Sprint is done, send the Planner a `conclude`
decision containing the full report body and the exact completion arguments
defined in the control protocol. The Planner submits that body unchanged and
owns only the close action. If the Sprint is not done, send the appropriate
pause, re-plan, cancel, or abort decision instead.

## Stop

For unit review, follow the ordered verdict procedure above: inbox handling and
all evidence work precede `record-review`; the durable verdict is the literal
last action, then the Reviewer stops.

For conformance, require the report and findings to replay idempotently, then
complete this final handoff order:

1. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`, act on newly arrived messages, and
   mark every handled informational message read with `accept`.
2. Confirm the Reviewer-authored Sprint report and conclude decision body are
   final and below the 8,000-character hard maximum.
3. As the literal final action of the turn, deliver that decision to the
   Planner:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <planner-shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --key <stable-conclude-handoff-key>
```

4. When the command confirms the durable write and Planner wake, stop
   immediately. Run no trailing command until another native wake arrives.',

  '# sprint_pln — govern the armed Sprint

Use as the originating Planner after `sprint_prep` arms the Sprint. The system
captures deterministic facts; the Reviewer decides and documents, and the
Planner acts. Execute Reviewer decisions without taking over their judgment or
report authorship. The FnB retains the board-level override established by
decision #46.
On every wake or re-entry, load `sprint_pln`, run the exact inbox command below,
and inspect the durable message before deciding what to do.

## Start from durable state

The armed runtime owns scheduled dispatch, unread wake recovery, liveness
evaluation, and registered-PR observation. React to its durable inbox and wake
facts; use the Planner turn for dispatch and exact execution of durable Reviewer
decisions. The Reviewer owns pause, cancel, and conclude decisions plus the
conformance and final Sprint reports. The Planner owns the corresponding state
transitions.

The active-chat registry is the only current-chat authority; zero or one chat
per shell is legal. Every wake message creates delivery intent and a wake turn
drains every undelivered message for the receiver. Planner-bound messages are
declared Re-enter. If a verified turn is live, every declared type enters that
chat at the natural boundary. When idle, Re-enter resumes the registry chat and
New rotates it; no registry row behaves as New.

FnB controls the Planner mode with the close button. Keeping the Planner chat
open supervises one continuous thread. Closing it during an armed Sprint sets
coordinate mode, so later idle Planner-bound Re-enters open fresh ticket chats;
FnB pause/resume returns to supervise. Automatic pauses preserve that choice.
Neither mode displaces a live turn. The inactivity ceiling closes a silent hung
chat, and the registry reaper terminates its now-unlinked process.

Read the Sprint inbox, lifecycle, bound spec revisions, work-unit graph,
participant routes, active conversations, registered PRs, unresolved
expectations, and recent anomalies. Viewing a participant conversation is
observation, not activity; never manufacture progress from browser presence.

```text
sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>
sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <message-id>
sc sprint decline --sprint <id> --message <message-id> --reason <reason>
```

Release every dependency-ready lane through the production surface:

```text
sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>
```

The returned ids are wake identities. Work-unit disposition and messages are
the authoritative release facts. Dispatch is safe to repeat: occupied Developer
lanes and stable assignment generations prevent double booking.

Accept or decline only when the inbox item is actionable. After acting on an
informational question, answer, blocker, or evidence message, run `accept` for
that message. For informational messages it only marks the message read; it does
not change Sprint or work-unit state.

## Running loop

- Keep dependencies as the only hard sequence. When reality requires a re-plan,
  give the Reviewer the current projection and evidence, then execute the exact
  decision it returns; never rewrite completed history.
- Let Developers own their PRs through green, review, correction, and merge.
  Let Reviewers own verdicts and Sprint decisions. Do not proxy routine
  handoffs or substitute Planner judgment for a Reviewer decision.
- Consume passive system facts without waking yourself into every transition.
  Route a decision boundary to the Reviewer; act when its Re-enter decision
  message arrives.
- Record the Reviewer decision identity, the exact action taken, and the action
  receipt. Do not rewrite its rationale as Planner-authored judgment evidence.
- A mid-Sprint spec edit is allowed only by the owning Planner or FnB. Record
  the prior and new exact revision hashes. When acting as Planner, require a
  durable Reviewer decision before the edit. The running Sprint remains bound
  to its approved revision unless that decision explicitly says otherwise.

The armed runtime evaluates liveness on its five-second pulse. A one-shot
diagnostic/evaluation is available when evidence requires it:

```text
sc sprint monitor --sprint <id>
```

Run `monitor` once for concrete evidence, then return control to native
delivery. It evaluates only due accepted expectations and its
nudge/escalation identities are durable. Use Sprint-native wakes for
coordination. Do not start a recurring shell loop, scheduled job, manual
participant boot, or external PR watcher to track Sprint state.

## Questions, answers, blockers, and failures

Put a concrete question, answer, decision, blocker, or useful context in a short
body file and address the participant who owns the needed fact or action:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --key <stable-key>
```

Answer incoming questions through `send` so the answer is durable and wakes the
asker, confirm that write, then mark the handled question read with `accept`.
For a cross-unit blocker, send evidence, impact, and the exact action needed to
every directly affected participant. Continue safe independent governance, but
stop at a decision boundary when an answer is required. Do not spam duplicates
when no response is immediate; unread recovery owns re-waking.

Choose one stable key for the intended recipient and exact body. Reuse it only
when retrying that same write; use a new key when the recipient or body changes.

Keep this Sprint message or result at about 6,000 characters or fewer; 8,000
characters is the hard maximum. Before submitting, run `wc -m < <path>` and
condense if needed. The handoff is complete only when the Sprint command exits
successfully and confirms the durable write and wake where applicable.

If a Sprint command is rejected or transport fails, the write or handoff is
incomplete. Correct and retry when safe. If the relay itself fails, surface the
attempted command and durable evidence to FnB; do not invent an alternate
delivery protocol. When a Developer reports an integrity concern, relay its
evidence, impact, and recommendation to the Reviewer. When the Reviewer returns
a decision, execute it through the protocol below. Send any needed participant
context before pausing; an active relay is not available after the lifecycle
becomes paused.

## Reviewer decision actions

Pause, cancel, and conclude are Reviewer decisions and Planner actions. A valid
decision arrives as a durable Reviewer → Planner Re-enter message and names the
decision, evidence, target ids, reason, and exact requested transition. Accept
the actionable message, verify it came from the assigned Reviewer, and execute
that transition without re-adjudicating the decision. Record the decision
message id and action receipt together.

The FnB board-level override from decision #46 is unaffected: a live FnB
instruction may direct or supersede any action. Name that override in the
evidence instead of attributing it to the Reviewer.

If a requested action fails a lifecycle, authority, or disposition precondition,
do not substitute a different action. Send the refusal and current durable state
back to the Reviewer (or surface it directly to FnB for an FnB override), then
stop at that decision boundary.

### Pause or resume

On a Reviewer pause decision, transition durably, stop external Sprint services,
persist interrupt intent, preserve every partial artifact, and retain the
Reviewer judgment and evidence for recovery:

```text
sc sprint pause --sprint <id> --reason <reviewer-decision-reason>
```

Resume only on a later Reviewer decision or an FnB override. Reconcile native
runs, unread messages, pending wakes, work units, registered PRs, capacity, and
spec drift, then act with the supplied reason:

```text
sc sprint resume --sprint <id> [--reason <reviewer-reconciliation-decision>]
```

An exhausted recovery wake is bounded manual-recovery evidence, not a retry
loop. Preserve the unread message and failed wake, involve FnB, and do not create
recursive fallbacks. Drift informs; it never silently blocks resume.

### Cancel or re-plan

A Reviewer cancel decision must name one unreleased work unit and its retained
terminal reason. Execute exactly that cancellation:

```text
sc sprint cancel-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> --reason <reviewer-decision-reason>
```

For a Reviewer re-plan decision, apply its complete projection; never infer
omitted fields or alter a released or completed lane:

```text
sc sprint replan-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> \
  --developer-shell <id> --reviewer-shell <id> --wave <n> \
  [--depends-on <work-unit-id>] [--output-kind code|report-only|no-code]
```

If a Developer or Reviewer declines, preserve the reason and ask the Reviewer
for the replacement routing decision before issuing a fresh assignment.

### Conclude or abort

The Reviewer decides when the Sprint is done, records conformance, authors the
final Sprint report, and sends a conclude decision containing the conformance
receipt, follow-up ids, exact reason/outcome, stable key, and full report body.
Write that Reviewer-authored body to `<reviewer-report>` unchanged, then perform
the close action:

```text
sc sprint complete --sprint <id> --reason <reviewer-decision-reason> \
  --outcome <reviewer-decision-outcome> --report-file <reviewer-report> \
  --key <reviewer-decision-key>
```

Do not run `compile-report`, synthesize the final report, or editorialize the
Reviewer body. Abort is likewise an action taken only on a Reviewer decision or
FnB override; it is terminal and deletes nothing.

## Handoffs and stop

Planner → Developer assignments are declared New; Developer → Reviewer review
requests are declared New; Developer/Reviewer → Planner results are Re-enter.
These are idle-time guarantees under the live-turn boundary rule, not a
parent/child chat topology. The Planner receives no PR-event wakes;
Developer-owned subscriptions carry red, green, and externally closed facts
directly to the owning Developer.

Never dispatch the next wave from a merge-observation turn. The Developer''s
merged-work handoff wake is the only normal next-wave dispatch trigger. On that
wake, complete the turn in this exact order:

1. Run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` and inspect the durable merged-work
   handoff plus current work-unit and dependency state.
2. Act on every earlier informational item and mark each handled item read with
   `accept`, including the Developer handoff.
3. Finish all reconciliation, judgment recording, and other Planner
   bookkeeping. No work remains after this step.
4. As the literal final action of the turn, release dependency-ready lanes:

```text

5. When the command confirms the durable assignment writes and New wakes, stop
   immediately. Run no trailing command. Empty dispatch is still the final
   action for that handoff turn; investigate only on a later durable wake.

When all planned delivery work is terminal and merged or explicitly no-code,
send the Reviewer the bound revisions, integrated main SHA, ratified judgments,
and current close evidence, then stop and await its Re-enter conclude decision.
The Reviewer writes the conformance and final Sprint reports; conformance
findings become follow-ups rather than new editing lanes in this Sprint.

On receipt, re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`, accept the conclude message,
execute its exact close action through the protocol above, and confirm the typed
transition succeeded. After `complete` succeeds, emit its bounded receipt and
run no further Sprint command. The Planner does not author a second report.',
